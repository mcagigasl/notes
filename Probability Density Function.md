The probability density function (PDF) of a continuous [[Random Variable]] $X$ is a function $f(x)$ such that the probability of $X$ falling within an interval $[a,b]$ is given by:
$$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx$$
In other words, we calculate the area of a certain function in the $[a,b]$ interval, the *densitiy* word stands for this area.
