Shared disk is a distributed computing architecture in which all the nodes in the system are linked to the same disk device but have their own private memory. The shared data is accessible from all cluster nodes and usually represents a shared disk (such as a [[database]]) or a shared filesystem (like a storage area network or network-attached storage).
