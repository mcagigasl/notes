A Normalisation is a database design approach within the tables of a database meant to:
* Be able to characterize the level of redundancy in a [[Relational Data Model]]
* Provide mechanisms for transforming schemas in order to remove redundancy

**Advantages**: 
* Normalization eliminates data redundancy: save on storage
* Better data integrity: accurate and consistent data

**Disadvantages**:
* Complex queries require more CPU

There are several [[Normalized Forms]] of a database, usually a Database is considered normalized if it meets the [[Third Normal Form]]
