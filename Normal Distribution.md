The normal  [[Probability Distribution]] is a probability distribution for a real [[random variable]]. The [[probability density function]] is based on both, the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution.

### Probability density function

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

### [[Cumulative distribution function]]

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$
