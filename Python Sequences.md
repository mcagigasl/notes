Sequences belong to [[Python Built-in Types]] . A sequence supports ordered, indexed collection of elements.

Key characteristics of sequences:

- **Ordered**: Items have a specific order.
- **Indexed**: Elements can be accessed by their index.
- **Iterable**: You can iterate over the elements in the sequence.

Common types of sequences:

- **[[Python Lists]]**: As discussed above, they are mutable ordered collections.
- **[[Python Tuples]]**: Immutable ordered collections. Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its elements.
- **[[Python Strings]]**: Sequences of characters (immutable).
- **[[Python iterables**: Represent sequences of numbers, usually for iteration.
