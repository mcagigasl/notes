NumPy Arrays (or Structured arrays), is the [[NumPy]]  base data structure. Is intended to perform [[Python Lists]] operations. `st_array=NumPy.array([list]) 


The main properties are:
* N-dimensional arrays
* Arrays are, by default, homogeneous. This allows a better way to perform operations at an array level.
* Allows arithmetic and boolean operations between arrays.
* Element-wise operation is possible.
