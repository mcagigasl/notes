Student's t distribution (or simply the t distribution) $t_Î½$  is a continuous [[probability distribution ]]that generalizes the standard [[normal distribution]]. It allows to estimate an unknown parameter - such as a mean - for a reduce sample with a unknown standard deviation.

It is specifically used when estimating a population mean from a small sample when the population standard deviation is unknown.
