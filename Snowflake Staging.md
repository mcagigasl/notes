[[Snowflake]] stages are named storage locations in Snowflake where you can temporarily load or unload data files before transferring them to Snowflake tables. A Snowflake stage essentially acts as a pointer or reference to a data file or set of data files. It enables Snowflake to access these data files for loading and unloading data without the need to copy or move the files. Stages can be external or internal.

Use cases for Snowflake Stages:

- Loading data from external sources into Snowflake tables for analysis and reporting purposes
- Unloading data from Snowflake tables to external destinations for backup or sharing
- Loading data from internal sources into Snowflake tables for transformation and processing
- Unloading data from Snowflake tables to internal destinations for temporary storage or staging
