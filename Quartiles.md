Quartiles are a type of [[quantiles]] which divide the number of data points into four parts:

+ $Q_1$ is defined as the 25th percentile
+ $Q_2$ is the median of the dataset
+ $Q_3$ is the 75th percentile

Along with the minimum, and the maximum of the data (which are also quartiles), quartiles provides a summary of both, the [[Measures of center|center]] and the [[Measures of spread|spread]] of the data.
