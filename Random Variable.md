A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to each possible outcome of a random experiment. .

### Key points:

1. Real-valued: A random variable takes real values, such as integers or continuous numbers, depending on the experiment.
2. Types:
    - Discrete Random Variable: Takes a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values. For example, the number of heads when flipping a coin multiple times.
    - Continuous Random Variable: Takes any value within a continuous range or interval. For example, the height of a person or the time it takes for a car to travel between two points.
3. Probability Distribution: The behavior of a random variable is described by its probability [[Probability Distribution]], which specifies the likelihood of different outcomes.
