Online transaction processing (OLTP) is a type of database system used in transaction-oriented applications, such as many operational systems. "Online" refers to the fact that such systems are expected to respond to user requests and process them in real-time (process transactions). 

The term is contrasted with [[Online Analytical Processing]] (OLAP) which instead focuses on data analysis (for example planning and management systems).
