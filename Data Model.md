A [[data]] model is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standarizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-word (or business) entities. It is the first phase for database design. Data models have three different levels: conceptual, logical and physical

## Levels

### Conceptual

A conceptual data model describes what the database contains, such as its entities, relationships, and attributes.
### Logical

A logical data model decides how the entities and relationships described in the conceptual model map to the [[Database Management Systems]]. For example, in a relational database, how entities and relationships map to tables.
### Physical 

A physical data model looks at how data will be physically stored at the lowest level of abstraction.
