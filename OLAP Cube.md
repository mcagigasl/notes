An OLAP cube is a data structure that allows for fast querying and analysis of large datasets. It organizes data in a multidimensional format, enabling users to perform complex calculations, trend analysis, and data mining operations across multiple dimensions (e.g., time, geography, product categories).

Each dimension of an OLAP cube corresponds to a [[Dimension Table]] in a [[Dimensional Model]]. 

OLAP Cubes are being replaced by:

* **Cloud-Based Analytics Platform**s: Modern cloud-based data platforms like Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, and Snowflake are often used for large-scale data analysis. These platforms provide scalable, high-performance querying without the need for complex, pre-aggregated cubes.

* **[[Columnar Databases]]**: Databases that store data in columns rather than rows, such as Amazon Redshift and Apache Parquet, are becoming more popular for analytical workloads. Columnar databases optimize analytical queries without the need for traditional OLAP cubes.

* **[[Data Lake|Data Lakes]] and [[ELT]] Pipelines**: Data lakes (using tools like Apache Spark, Databricks, or Azure Synapse) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipelines allow analysts to work with raw data in its native form, offering more flexibility and scalability than OLAP cubes. These solutions often use SQL-on-Hadoop engines or distributed data processing to enable real-time analytics.

* **Self-Service BI Tools**: Tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Looker are shifting the focus away from OLAP cubes, offering users self-service capabilities to directly connect to data sources. These tools can perform real-time queries and aggregations without the need for pre-structured OLAP cubes.
