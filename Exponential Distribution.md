The exponential distribution or negative exponential distribution is the [[probability distribution]] of the distance between events in a [[Poisson Distribution|Poisson]] point process. In other words, is the probability of a certain time passing between Poisson events. Unlike Poisson distribution, the exponential distribution is continuous.

+ Poisson problem: probability for a client arrives to a restaurant between 10:00 and 11:00
+ Exponential problem: the probability that a table in a restaurant remains unoccupied for ten minutes."
