# üìÖ Notes

- It would be useful to create a Vault not only for work, but for general ideas too. 
- Autoficci√≥n, que lo define c√≥mo "g√©nero"? El "yo" del narrador? Es un espacio muy peque√±o? Est√° alejado de la literatura por su falta de universalidad? 
- Yesterday, I try to deep in some math concepts, such as distributions, loosing the purpose of the DataCamp - by the way, what is this purpose exactly?. 
- I need some way to manage my **worm wholes**:
	- Obsidian 
	- Distributions
	- Snowflake
- It would be useful to add to daily note template a schema for the day.
- It would be useful to do little tasks early in the morning. 
- Scypi.stats as stats library for python.
