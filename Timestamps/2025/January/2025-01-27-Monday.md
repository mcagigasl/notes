# üìÖ Notes

- Manuel, you must to keep focus on what you are doing. Don't start anything new. Don't get thrilled by your new Obsidian obsession.  You have a personal project, that's fine, but stay focus on important things.
- **English**: Return to focus on it. I need to decide between a backtracking strategy or  continue strategy.
	- It would interesting to have all homework done.
	- Ir would be interesting to make a plan too.
