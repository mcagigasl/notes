A **data lake** is designed to store large volumes of raw, unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data. Unlike traditional databases, data lakes do not require data to be cleaned or structured before storing it.

## Key Characteristics

- **Data Structure**: Stores **raw, unstructured, semi-structured**, and **structured data**. Data can be stored in any format, including text files, images, videos, logs, JSON, XML, etc.
- **Storage Format**: Flexible storage formats (e.g., **JSON**, **CSV**, **Parquet**, **ORC**, **AVRO**). The data is stored in its **native format** without much transformation.
- **Data Processing**: Data lakes are typically used for **big data analytics** and **advanced data processing** (e.g., data science, machine learning, and AI). They support both **batch processing** and **streaming**.
- **Querying**: Can use **big data processing frameworks** like **Apache Spark**, **Hive**, **Presto**, or **Apache Drill** to query large datasets. Tools like **SQL-on-Hadoop** allow querying raw data stored in Hadoop-compatible formats.
- **Scalability**: Data lakes are designed to scale horizontally and store **massive** amounts of data, often in **distributed** systems.
- **Cost**: Generally, data lakes are **more cost-effective** for storing massive amounts of data compared to relational databases or data warehouses.
## **Use Cases**:

- Big data storage, machine learning model training, advanced analytics, data exploration, and research.
- Storing data from various sources such as log files, sensors, images, videos, social media, etc.
