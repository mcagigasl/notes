A **dimensional model** is a [[data model]] approach designed to optimize the **querying** and **analysis** of large datasets, particularly in the context of **[[Data Warehouse]]** and **business intelligence** systems. It is optimized [[OLAP]] queries: aggregate data, not updating.

It organizes data into **[[Fact Table]]** (for metrics) and **[[Dimension Table]]** (for descriptive context), making it efficient for analytical and reporting purposes. The model is particularly popular because it simplifies data access and supports high-performance querying for analytical workloads.

The **[[Star Schema]]** and **[[Snowflake Schema]]** are two common ways to design a dimensional model, each with its trade-offs in terms of simplicity, performance, and redundancy.
