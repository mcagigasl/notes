The goal of a  [[Data Warehouse| data warehouse]] architecture is to determine how records from  data sources should be extracted, transformed, loaded ([[ETL]]) and organised.

There are two different approaches for a DW architecture:
+ The [[Inmon mode]]l: EDW approach (top-down)
+ The [[Kimball Model]]: Data mart apporach (bottom-up)
