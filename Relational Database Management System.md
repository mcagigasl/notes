**RDBMS** refers to **software** that stores, manages, and organizes data in a relational format (using tables, rows, and columns). An RDBMS uses [[SQL]] as its query language.

 RDBMS systems are designed to store and retrieve data efficiently, ensuring data integrity, security, and consistency. They also manage things like concurrency control, transaction management, and data relationships.
 
Examples of RDBMSs include **[[MySQL]]**, **[[PostgreSQL]]**, **[[Microsoft SQL Server]]**, **Oracle[[ Database]]**, and **[[SQLite]]**.
