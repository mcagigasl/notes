The Poisson distribution  is a discrete [[probability distribution]] that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time if these events occur with a known constant [[measures of center|mean]] rate and independently of the time since the last event.

## [[Probability Mass Function]]

A discrete [[random variable]] $X$ is said to have a Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda > 0$ if it has a probability mass function given by
$$f(k;\lambda) = Pr(X=k) = \frac{\lambda^ke^-\lambda}{k!}$$
where
+ $k$ is the number of occurrences 
+ e is the Euler's number
+ $\lambda$ is the average number of events in a certain interval
