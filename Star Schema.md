The star schema or star model, is a [[Database Schema]]. It is the simplest style of [[Data Mart]] schema and is the approach most widely used to develop [[Data Warehouse]].

The star schema consists of one or more [[Fact Table]] referencing any number of [[Dimension Table]]. The star schema is an important special case of the [[Snowflake Schema]], and is more effective for handling simpler queries. Sometimes the terms [[Dimensional Model]] and [[Star Schema]] are interchangeable.
