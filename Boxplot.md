A boxplot is a standarized way of displaying a dataset base on the [[five-number summary]]. In addition, sometimes the IQR range is added to visualize [[outliers]]. Sometimes there can be lines (called whiskers) extending of the box indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles.

## Use cases
+ When we have a continuous variable, split by a categorical one.
+ When you want tu compare the distribution of the continuous variables for each category.
