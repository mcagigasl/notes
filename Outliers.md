An outlier is a [[data]] point that differs significantly from other observations. There is no rigid mathematical definition of what constitutes an outlier.

If $Q_1$ and $Q_3$  are the first, and the third quartiles, and the $IQR = Q_1 -Q_2$ an outlier is a data point liying outside the following fences:
Lower Fence = $Q_1 - (1.5 \times IQR)$
Upper Fence = $Q_3 - (15\times IQR)$
